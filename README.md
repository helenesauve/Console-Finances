# Unit 4 Challenge: Console Finances

## Description
 
This is Challenge 4 of the Front-End Web Developer bootcamp. In this challenge, I have created a code for analyzing the financial records of a company. 


Given the set of data provided in the script.js file, the task was to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

* The total number of months included in the dataset.

* The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The average of the **changes** in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

* The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

* The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

The final code looks like the below when loaded on the Console:
